# Snake_Game

Snake Game through Python is a project made with the help of following Python Modules/Libraries: turtle, time and random.
It is a mini project with an aim to revise and update the Python Object Oriented Programming concepts and making them more better by actually developing a robust, readable and understandable code.
Functioning of the game is very simple. Just like other Snake Games the game always has a moving food for the snake in random direction all over the screen and the Snake tries to eat it. The screen size is about '700 X 700' pixels. The player just neeed to move the snake with the NumPad numbers: 8 -> for forward movement, 2 -> for backward movement,        4 -> for left side movement  and 6 -> for right side movement.
